## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with basic model deployment using Flask/FastAPI
2. Learn containerization with Docker
3. Implement experiment tracking with MLflow
4. Build CI/CD pipelines for ML projects
5. Add monitoring and alerting systems
6. Practice A/B testing for model validation
7. Deploy complete production systems

## 💡 Project Ideas

- **Model API Service:** RESTful API for ML model predictions
- **Batch Prediction Pipeline:** Automated batch scoring system
- **ML Pipeline Orchestration:** End-to-end training and deployment pipeline
- **Model Drift Detection:** Monitoring system for data and model drift
- **A/B Testing Platform:** Framework for testing model variants
- **Multi-Model Serving:** System to serve multiple model versions
- **AutoML Pipeline:** Automated model selection and tuning
- **Feature Store:** Centralized feature management system

## 🏗 Architecture Patterns

### Deployment Patterns
- **Online/Real-time:** Synchronous API calls
- **Batch:** Offline prediction jobs
- **Streaming:** Real-time data processing
- **Edge:** On-device model deployment

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal scaling:** Multiple model instances
- **Vertical scaling:** Increase instance resources
- **Auto-scaling:** Dynamic resource allocation
- **Load balancing:** Distribute requests efficiently

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- **Model Performance:** Accuracy, latency, throughput
- **Data Quality:** Missing values, schema changes, distributions
- **Model Drift:** Performance degradation over time
- **Infrastructure:** CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Business Metrics:** ROI, user satisfaction, business KPIs

## 🔄 Best Practices

- **Version everything:** Code, data, models, configurations
- **Automate testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, model validation
- **Monitor continuously:** Set up alerts for anomalies
- **Document thoroughly:** Model cards, API documentation
- **Security first:** Authentication, authorization, data privacy
- **Gradual rollouts:** Canary deployments, blue-green deployments
