# Project Name

Brief description of your data science project.

## Project Overview

Describe the problem you're solving, the data you're using, and the expected outcomes.

## Data

- **Source:** Where does your data come from?
- **Size:** How much data do you have?
- **Features:** What variables are you working with?
- **Target:** What are you trying to predict/understand?

## Setup

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Setup

1. Place raw data files in `data/raw/`
2. Run data processing pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/data/make_dataset.py
   ```

## Usage

### Training

```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

### Prediction

```bash
python src/models/predict_model.py
```

### Visualization

```bash
python src/visualization/visualize.py
```
